            Bivy Maps is a web application I designed and created and coded with a partner. The app displays free user generated camping locations all around the world. Sites are displayed on an embedded Google Maps with custom icons marking the locations. Logged in users are able to add, edit and delete campsites they created and anyone can view other usersâ€™ campsites and get directions. Each campsite has numerous amenities and features as well as the local weather at the site.

            Digitized version of a board game currently in development. In PsyberWar players play as either Russia or the US and vie for political control of Europe using disinformation and exploiting opponents operational security. The game is a logic heavy strategy game including five different decks and over 150 cards. Cards are dealt differently based on how far into the game players are. The board is animated depending on relevant stats of each player and turns.
