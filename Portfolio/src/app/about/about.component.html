        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion for learning new subjects on the frontier of contemporary technological
            trends and more specifically anything related to machine learning.
            <br><br>In the past year I have taught myself three different full stacks as well as numerous other technologies and
            resources to aid in web development. I primarily work in MEAN stack and Python but am also familiar with C# and am
            able to pick up other languages quickly.
            <br><br>I am eager to work with anyone who is able to encourage and push me to develop my skills and shares my passion
            for new technologies.</h3>
